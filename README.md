### **_Description_**

Solitaire is a card game that you play by yourself, hence its name. The goal is to move all the cards into 4 piles at the top of the board. In the top four, you can only add to a pile if it is the same suit and one value higher. In the bottom seven, you can only add to a pile if it is a different color and one value lower. Draw from the deck to get more cards.

### **_Technologies Used_**

In order to shuffle the deck of cards, I used Fisher-Yates algorithm, which I found on Stack Overflow. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
